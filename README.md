hello mothafuckers so yh this is where we will regularly update one another on the code changes. 
Do not forget to create a new branch for the edits you make to the code and try to avoiud making changes to the main code.
When changes are made just upload to your branch and update the read me with your name. 

Example:
Casey branch castle blanc
I just did the php file for bla bla bla in my branch. 

Capisce??

-Casey-branch commit

New files for editing guys check em out. the login, signup and home page. 
although everyone should check out the home page too and its CSS for the header and footer so we have an idea what i was saying.
